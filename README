Coypright Mozbugbox <mozbugbox@yahoo.com.au> 2011-2013
Released under GPL version 3 or later.

Add simple network traffice monitor icons to the desktop panel/taskbar. The
icons show bandwidth usage of all the network interfaces on a Linux system.

Home: https://bitbucket.org/mozbugbox/byteonpanel/

Usage
=====

Copy the "src/byteonpanel" file into your path and run it. It will check your
network interfaces and pop some icons on your desktop panel/taskbar.

Dependents
==========
Python version: gtk+-3.0, python-gobject, python-cairo

Vala version: vala > 0.10.0, libcairo, gtk+-3.0

Build
=====
Install the devel package for the dependents first.
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make install

Python Version
==============
The original code was written in Python. Later on, it's ported to vala language
for smaller footprint.

The python version is in the file dist/byteonpanel.py, while the vala version
is in dist/src/*.vala.

LXDE Autostart
==============

* Copy the "byteonpanel.desktop" file to $HOME/.config/autostart/.

* Then open LXDE->Preferences->Desktop Session Settings->Automatically Started
  Applications->ByteOnPanel.

* Check the box. 

* Finally logout and login.

Vola! We have icewm like network activity monitors!


whorfin tweaks
============
I prefer "bps" (bits per second) instead of "B" (bytes per second)
If you do not:
* remove -D BITS_NOT_BYTES from byteonpanel_VALAFLAGS in src/Makefile.am
$ make clean
$ autoreconf
$ ./configure
